Dataset Title:
Accelerometer-based Motor Vibration Dataset for Evaluating Deep Neural Network Anomaly Detection

Dataset Description:
This dataset contains vibration data collected from an industrial water pump using an Adafruit ADXL345 accelerometer. The purpose of the dataset is to facilitate precise evaluation and benchmarking of deep neural network (DNN) models designed for anomaly detection and predictive maintenance.

Vibrations at different intensities were intentionally introduced to the real industrial motor by attaching screws of varying sizes and weights onto the rotating shaft. These screws induced rotational imbalances, causing varying intensities of vibration without mechanical failure. The resulting dataset provides realistic scenarios to effectively assess the capabilities of machine learning models.

Data Collection Methodology:
Data were recorded using an ESP32S3 microcontroller at a sampling rate of 100 Hz (100 samples per second).

Each data segment (chunks) contains 100 samples, equivalent to 1 second of recorded accelerometer measurements.

Each sample includes a timestamp and vibration readings along the X, Y, and Z axes (in gravitational acceleration, g).

Dataset Categories:
The dataset consists of five operational scenarios:

Motor_off: Motor turned off; captures baseline accelerometer measurements without vibration.

Normal_data: Motor operating under standard operational conditions without induced imbalances.

Abnormal_data_low: Motor operating with small screws attached, producing low-intensity vibrations.

Abnormal_data_medium: Motor with medium-sized screws attached, resulting in medium-intensity vibrations.

Abnormal_data_high: Motor operating with large screws attached, generating high-intensity vibrations due to pronounced rotational imbalances.

Dataset Size:
Motor_off category includes 331 files (chunks) each containing 100 samples
Normal_data category includes 1256 files (chunks) each containing 100 samples
Abnormal data category with three vibration intesity each with 590 files
In total: 125,600 normal samples, 33,100 motor off state samples, and 177,000 abnormal samples.

Data Format:
Each CSV file contains no headers, with four columns:
- Timestamp (seconds), interval: 0.01 sec (sampling at 100 Hz)
- X-axis acceleration (g)
- Y-axis acceleration (g)
- Z-axis acceleration (g)



Applications:
Benchmarking and evaluating DNN-based anomaly detection models.

Developing and validating machine learning models (CNN, LSTM, Autoencoders) tailored for vibration analysis.

Demonstrating the effectiveness and performance of TinyML models on constrained edge devices.

Experimental Setup:
Data were collected under controlled but realistic industrial conditions. Vibrations were generated by attaching screws of different sizes onto the rotating shaft of an actual industrial motor. These screws introduced precise rotational imbalances, enabling systematic assessment of anomaly detection algorithms under realistic operational anomalies without involving artificial simulations or mechanical faults.
